###Preraring keys and certificates

######Go to Apple Developer's portal and get your iOS Pass Type ID. If you are using MacOS, export it's key as *.pem file. Be sure that your certificate is signed on the apple developer's portal. Please, use [official passbook documentation]https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Chapters/YourFirst.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH2-SW1 to do that prorerly 

######I've also tried to do that stuff using Fedora. It's possible with SSL but a bit more difficult though.
